# Contributing

What you should do depends on the reason : 

## Found a bug

A bug is when the effective behavior does not match the expected one. 

Please explain all the steps involved to reproduce the issue, as well as how the effective behaviour is not the expected behaviour.

If the issue is very simple, a simple screenshot as well as the actions taken could suffice. 

## Request for improvement

Create an issue explaining the why, how, when. If the explanations are not good enough, it will be closed.

## Improvement

If it's a simpole bug, you still need to create an issue.

## Creating a PR

Your branch name should contain the id of the issue,like issue#issuenumber . Then each commit message should start with "issue #issuenumber" . Of course you can create a new branch before you make your PR, so that only the modified branch needs to conform to that naming.
